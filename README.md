 - The simulation of a monster will end if the maximum number of ticks (default 1k \* 1k = 1M) is exceeded, or when the desired number of trials have been simulated.
   - **"\# Trials"** is the number of fights that are simulated for each monster. Default is 1000.
   - **"Max tick/trial"** is the maximum number of ticks per trial. The ticks are pooled over all trials for a monster. Default is 1000, this corresponds with 20s fights.
 - If **"Heal After Death"** is enabled, food will be consumed after a player death to bring the player back to full health. If it is disabled, the next fight will begin with the default health (20%). Enabled by default.
 - If **"Has Runes"** is disabled, the simulator will assume that the player has no runes, and no spells will be cast. Enabled by default.

 - With **Settings Import** you can paste a settings export JSON string in the text box, and import it to the sim with the button.
 - **Data Export** creates a JSON string with the current simulation results, and copies it to your clipboard. If the clipboard is not available, a modal containing the JSON is opened instead.
   - If **Dungeon Monsters** is enabled, all monsters in a dungeon will be included in the data export JSON.
   - If **Non-Simulated** is enabled, entities that were not simulated will be included in the data export JSON.
